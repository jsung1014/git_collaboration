This is my info201 exercise

Ji Min Sung: This class is so much fun and I'm so glad that I have such a best TA in the world!
I don't know what to write here so I am writing so random stuff.

Junhee Park: TRUE!! I also agree with you that we have a best TA in the entire universe! I hope we get to learn more about coding in R studio! I cannot wait what learning is ahead of us!:)
